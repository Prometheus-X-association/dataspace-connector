# Exchange Trigger API Key

The Exchange Trigger API Key is a key generated by the PTX catalogue to allow secure communication between the data space connector and the PTX platform when initiating data exchange processes.

The field is optional and only needed when using the PTX catalogue for data exchange processes.

## Configuration

Once generated the key can be configured in the connector .env file using the following variable:


```dotenv
EXCHANGE_TRIGGER_API_KEY=your_generated_api_key_here
```
> Once set, you will need to restart your connector for the changes to take effect.
