# Exchange Trigger API Key

The Exchange Trigger API Key is a key generated by the PTX catalogue to allow secure communication between the data space connector and the PTX catalogue API when initiating data exchange processes.

The field is optional and only needed when using the PTX catalogue for data exchange processes.

## Overview

The idea of this feature is to take away as much integration work as possible from dataspace participants by enabling the PTX Catalogue, which has the information about participants, offers and contracts to offer an "Exchange Trigger" dashboard feature where participants can trigger an exchange with a simple click of a button.

This essentially removes having to:

* Retrieve your different signed contracts
* Configure the exchange payloads to target specific offers in the contract
* Implementing a search logic to identify relevant exchanges based on all that you have available
* Triggering service chains without worrying about setting up the service chain payloads

## Configuration

To configure this feature, there are a couple requirements:

1. Your used PTX Catalogue should have a feature to generate an exchange trigger API Key.
2. You need to generate this API Key
3. You need to configure this API Key in your PDC's .env file using the following configuration:

```dotenv
EXCHANGE_TRIGGER_API_KEY=your_generated_api_key_here
```

> Once set, you will need to restart your connector for the changes to take effect.
