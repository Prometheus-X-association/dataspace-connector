curl -X POST "http://your-connector/private/credentials" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-api-token" \
  -d '{
        "type": "s3",
        "content": {
          "accessKeyId": "your-access-key-id",
          "secretAccessKey": "your-secret-access-key",
          "region": "your-region"
        }
      }'
```
